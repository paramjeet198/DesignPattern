# The Factory Design pattern is the creational design pattern.
# It defines an interface or an abstract class for creating objects.
# It is useful when we have a super class with multiple subclasses.
# Factory acts as the central point for creating specific instances/objects based on input type.
# The client code interacts with the factory to obtain desired objects on the basis of given input.


BENEFITS of Factory Design pattern:
# Loose Coupling: Client code doesn't directly depend on concrete classes.
# Flexibility: Factory dynamically creates objects based on input.
# Centralized Control: Object creation logic is centralized, simplifying maintenance.
